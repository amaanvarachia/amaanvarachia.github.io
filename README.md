[Clustering project](https://github.com/amaanvarachia/Data-Science-Unsupervised-Learning/blob/main/Clustering%20code.ipynb): This project explored the use of k means clustering to a data set of grocery shoppers and used clustering to group people that favor certain foods example high in dairy,grocery and fresh produce but low in detergent and deli meats. Determing the amount of clusters was done by the 'silhouette' and elbow methods.

Using another data set of stock prices, the data was standardized and cluster analysis was perfomed on it. Using the clusters a Random Forest regression was run using the clusters as extra input features as well as a Random Forest model that used no clustering analysis with it. Results show a slight increase in the Reciever operating characteristic curve when using the 5 clusters as features on top of the available data.
